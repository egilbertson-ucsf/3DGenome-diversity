### bam_cov.py

Transform BAM alignments to a normalized BigWig (or HDF5-stored) coverage track.

| Arguments | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bam_file | BAM/CRAM | Alignments file from which to extract coverage. |
| output_file | BigWig/HDF5 | Output coverage track stored as BigWig or HDF5, depending on the ".bw" suffix. |
| hdf5_file | HDF5 | Output HDF5 file with train_in/train_out, test_in/test_out and many other keys. |

<a name="hdf5_single"/>

### basenji_hdf5_single.py

Combine a set of coverage tracks stored as BigWig or HDF5 into a single file for training and testing, parallelizing over samples per-segment using multiprocessing on a single machine.

| Arguments | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fasta_file | FASTA | FASTA file of chromosome sequences. |
| sample_wigs_file | Text table | Sample labels and paths to coverage files. |
| hdf5_file | HDF5 | Output HDF5 file with train_in/train_out, test_in/test_out and many other keys. |

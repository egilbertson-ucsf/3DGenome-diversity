# Jupyter notebooks for analysis and vizualization
- AncestralPairAnalysis: reading in 3d comparison files and formatting them for downstream analysis comparing modern individuals to ancestral
- AncestralSequence_trees: using tskit to create vcf files of ancestral variants from input tree sequence files
- Figure2: Analyses and vizualizations for figures 2 and 3 comparing modern individuals to ancestral and functional annotations across 3D divergence deciles
- Pairwise_sequence: analysis of pairwise sequence comparisons
- clustering and clustering_makingbasetree: clustering analysis of 3D comparisons and creating a baseline sequence clustering tree to use as input to ASTRAL analysis
- expected_divergence: analysis and vizualization of expected divergence and evolutionary constraint data based on random sequence shuffles
- experimental: experimental data validation and exploration
- in_silico_mutagenesis: analysis of in silico mutagenesis results
- visualize_maps: code for nicely visualizing predicted 3D contact maps.

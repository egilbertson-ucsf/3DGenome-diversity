# Human 3D Genome Diversity

This repository houses data and scripts used in the Human 3D Genome Diversity project.
See also https://github.com/brandcm/Pan_3d_Genome/tree/main and https://github.com/emcarthur/neanderthal-3D-genome for related manuscripts and analyses. 

- The data directory contains many of the data used in the analysis. Due to space constraints, some of the larger files (e.g., FASTAs and VCFs), are not included here but the means to retrieve or generate such files is described in the directory README.md.
- basenji: copy of https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master to be used in generating Akita predictions. 
- makeFASTA: contains scripts that generate pseudo-haploid sequences per individual from filtered genotypes.
- runningAkita: contains scripts to generate 3d maps from FASTAs using Akita
- comparingAkitaPreds: contains scripts to compare 3d maps generated by Akita
- activeNotebooks: jupyter notebooks used for analysis and visualization throughout the project.
- expectedDivergence: Scripts to generate shuffled sequences and expected 3D divergence using sequence variation from one individuals at a time.
- sequenceComps: scripts for calculating pairwise SNP divergence on various window scales for specified pairs of individuals.
- window_scale: scripts for subsetting 3d map predictions to smaller window sizes
- scripts: other utility scripts
- 3_in_silico_mutagenesis: scripts for in silico mutagenesis and subsequent 3d map prediction
